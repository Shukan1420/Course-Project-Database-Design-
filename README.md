# Quantum Cars Database Design
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for documenting the design and implementation of a database system tailored specifically for Quantum Cars, a leading automotive company. This project is part of a course project, and it is structured into different phases, each representing a significant milestone in the database design process. From requirements gathering to performance tuning, each phase will be meticulously documented with detailed descriptions, diagrams, and scripts. We encourage contributions and feedback from the community to enhance the database design and ensure its effectiveness in supporting Quantum Cars' operations. Thank you for your interest in our project, and we look forward to collaborating with you on this exciting endeavor.
